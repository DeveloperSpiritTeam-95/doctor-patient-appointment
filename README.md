# doctor-patient-appointment


The doctor-patient-appointment project facilitates the scheduling and management of appointments between doctors and patients. It includes features for patients to book appointments with available doctors, view their appointment history, and receive reminders. For doctors, it provides a calendar view of appointments, patient information, and tools for managing their schedules efficiently. This project improves the appointment booking process, enhances patient-doctor communication, and streamlines administrative tasks in healthcare settings.
